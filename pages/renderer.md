# Mirador Rendering Pipelines

This document provides an overview of the rendering pipelines that power the visual experience in the Mirador 3D maze game.

## Overview

All rendering in Mirador is orchestrated by the `WgpuRenderer` struct, which encapsulates the GPU device, surface, and all rendering pipelines. The rendering system is modular, with specialized sub-renderers for different aspects of the game, such as the main 3D maze, animated backgrounds, and loading or transition effects.

## Core Structures

### WgpuRenderer – Central Rendering Manager

The `WgpuRenderer` struct is the central hub for all GPU-based rendering in Mirador. It manages the WGPU device and queue, the window surface, and contains the main rendering pipelines for both the game and animation sequences.

```rust
pub struct WgpuRenderer {
    pub surface: wgpu::Surface<'static>,
    pub surface_config: wgpu::SurfaceConfiguration,
    pub device: wgpu::Device,
    pub queue: wgpu::Queue,
    pub game_renderer: GameRenderer,
    pub animation_renderer: AnimationRenderer,
}
```
{: .language-rust}

#### Key Responsibilities:
- **Surface and Device Management**: Handles the GPU device, command queue, and presentation surface.
- **Pipeline Initialization**: Sets up and manages all rendering pipelines used throughout the game.
- **Delegation**: Delegates actual drawing to specialized sub-renderers for different visual components.

### GameRenderer – Main 3D Maze and Scene Pipeline

The `GameRenderer` struct is responsible for rendering the core 3D maze, floor, and background effects during gameplay. It manages the main render pipeline, vertex and uniform buffers, and several sub-renderers for additional effects.

```
pub struct GameRenderer {
    pub pipeline: wgpu::RenderPipeline,
    pub vertex_buffer: wgpu::Buffer,
    pub vertex_count: u32,
    pub uniform_buffer: wgpu::Buffer,
    pub uniform_bind_group: wgpu::BindGroup,
    pub depth_texture: Option<wgpu::Texture>,
    pub star_renderer: StarRenderer,
    pub debug_renderer: DebugRenderer,
}
```
{: .language-rust}

#### Key Components:
- **pipeline**: The main WGPU render pipeline for the maze and floor geometry.
- **vertex_buffer**: Combined buffer for all maze and floor vertices.
- **uniform_buffer & uniform_bind_group**: Store and bind transformation matrices for the shaders.
- **depth_texture**: Optional depth buffer for correct 3D occlusion.
- **star_renderer**: Renders animated starfield backgrounds.
- **debug_renderer**: Provides tools for visualizing bounding boxes and debug overlays.

### AnimationRenderer – Title Screen and Transition Effects

The `AnimationRenderer` struct is dedicated to rendering animated sequences, such as the title screen maze, loading bars, and special exit effects. It combines maze generation logic with specialized sub-renderers for each visual element.

```rust
pub struct AnimationRenderer {
    pub generator: MazeGenerator,
    pub maze: Arc<Mutex<Maze>>,
    pub maze_renderer: MazeRenderer,
    pub loading_bar_renderer: LoadingBarRenderer,
    pub exit_shader_renderer: ExitShaderRenderer,
    pub texture: wgpu::Texture,
    pub last_update: Instant,
}
```
{: .language-rust}

#### Key Components:
- **maze_renderer**: Renders the animated maze during title or transition screens.
- **loading_bar_renderer**: Displays loading progress with a visual bar.
- **exit_shader_renderer**: Creates animated effects for the maze exit.
- **texture**: Stores the maze image as a GPU texture.
- **last_update**: Tracks timing for smooth animation.

## Rendering Flow

Each frame, the rendering process follows this sequence:

1. **State Update**: Game and animation state are updated based on input and timing.
2. **Pipeline Selection**: Depending on the game state (e.g., gameplay, loading, title), either `game_renderer` or `animation_renderer` is used.
3. **Scene Rendering**: The selected renderer draws its components to the frame buffer, including the maze, background, and any overlays or effects.
4. **Presentation**: The composed frame is presented to the window surface.

This architecture allows for clear separation between gameplay rendering and animated sequences, while sharing GPU resources efficiently.

## Extending the Rendering System

The rendering system is designed for extensibility. New visual effects or scene elements can be added by extending the relevant renderer structs and their pipelines. For example, to add a new animated effect, you would implement a new sub-renderer and integrate it into either `GameRenderer` or `AnimationRenderer`.
